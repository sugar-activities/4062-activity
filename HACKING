Development
===========

Sources directory is not intended to be used as-is in sugar.

Instead, run `./setup.py dev` to make TamTam*.activity directories that are
ready to start from sugar shell.

How to contribute
=================

Useful notes how to contribute to the project.

Send patches
------------
Create your patches using ``git format`` command and send them to all
maintainers from the :ref:`AUTHORS <AUTHORS>` file. The easiest way is using
``git send-email`` command. Patches might be CCed to
sugar-devel@lists.sugarlabs.org to attract more people to review.

Gitorious forks
---------------
Another useful way to contribute, especially for big improvements, is creating
Gitorious forks and request them for merge to the trunk.
